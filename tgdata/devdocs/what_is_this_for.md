# What Is This For?

## Overview

The Telegram Group Message Crawler is a Python library designed to programmatically access, retrieve, and process messages from Telegram groups and channels. It provides a clean, extensible API for developers who need to work with Telegram group data in their applications.

## Core Purpose

This library serves as a bridge between the Telegram API (via Telethon) and your application, offering:

1. **Message Retrieval**: Systematically fetch messages from Telegram groups/channels
2. **Data Processing**: Filter, deduplicate, and transform message data
3. **Progress Tracking**: Monitor long-running operations with callbacks
4. **Connection Management**: Handle rate limits and connection pooling
5. **Data Export**: Export messages in various formats (CSV, JSON)

## Key Problems It Solves

### 1. **Complexity Abstraction**
- Hides the complexity of Telegram's MTProto protocol
- Provides a simple, intuitive API for common operations
- Handles authentication and session management

### 2. **Rate Limit Management**
- Automatically handles Telegram's rate limits
- Implements retry logic with exponential backoff
- Supports connection pooling for better throughput

### 3. **Message Deduplication**
- Prevents downloading the same messages multiple times
- Supports various storage backends for tracking
- Enables resumable operations after interruptions

### 4. **Large-Scale Data Handling**
- Efficiently processes thousands of messages
- Provides progress tracking for long operations
- Supports date-based filtering to limit data retrieval

## Target Audience

This library is designed for:

- **Data Analysts**: Who need to analyze Telegram group conversations
- **Researchers**: Studying communication patterns or content
- **Developers**: Building applications that integrate with Telegram
- **Archivists**: Creating backups of important group discussions
- **Moderators**: Monitoring group activity and content

## What It's NOT For

- **Spamming or Flooding**: This is for legitimate data retrieval only
- **User Account Automation**: This uses user accounts, not bots
- **Real-time Messaging**: This is for batch processing, not live chat
- **Breaking Telegram's ToS**: Always respect Telegram's terms of service

## Design Philosophy

1. **Clean Architecture**: Separation of concerns with specialized engines
2. **Extensibility**: Interface-based design for custom implementations
3. **Developer Experience**: Simple API with sensible defaults
4. **Reliability**: Comprehensive error handling and recovery
5. **Performance**: Efficient data processing with caching

## Getting Started

```python
from tgdata import TgData

# Simple usage
tg = TgData()
groups = await tg.list_groups()
messages = await tg.get_messages(group_id=12345, limit=100)
```

This library makes Telegram group data accessible for legitimate analysis and processing needs while respecting rate limits and providing a clean, Pythonic interface.
